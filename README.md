# Weather-Forecast
It is a GUI based app made with Tkinter, which will take inputs from the user about the region to show weather forecast of and will then show the weather forecast of that region for the next 3 days and plot it in order to help us visualize the trend

## Installation 
You can install requests, matplotlib,tkinter, json and math via pip 

## Usage 
Type the region of which you want the weather report and press search. 
You'll get the following:
 1. Current date
 2. Local time 
 3. Name of the country the region belongs to 
 4. Minimum temperature
 5. Maximum temperature
 6. Average temperature
 7. Current temperature
 8. Time of sunrise
 9. Time of sunset
 
Then you can either click the reset button and then type in a different region, or you could click the " Click to graph the forecast button".
Which in turn will open another window with the "show trend for the next 3 days" Button. 
When you click on that button, you will see the weather metrics for the next 3 days graphed.
